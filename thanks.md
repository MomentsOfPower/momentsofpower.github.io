This website was created using GitHub Page, jekyll, just-the-docs, and the beta action. 
We truly stand on the shoulders of giants. 
The source code is all visible on GitHub, so please feel free to take inspiration. 

The idea of moments of power has evolved over a decade of research on hybrid powertrains.
Again, we stand on the shoulders of gians, and I have to mention the QSS toolbox, Advisor,
and of course MATLAB/Simulink as software pieces that have helped on this journey.
