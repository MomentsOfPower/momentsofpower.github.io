This website is dedicated to the "moments of power" methodology, as introduced in the SAE Paper 2023-01-0541. See https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2023-01-0541/ for the details. 

The key idea rests on two factors:

1. That a power system can be described using a basis function model, for example a polynomial model over power demand, and
2. That the statistical distribution of the input variable variable can be measured using the same basis functions.

Based on those two assumptions, efficiency, losses, consumption etc can be determined without simualtion. 

The methodology applies to a wide range of energy systems: automotive, aeronautical, thermal, solar, wind, batteries, fuel cells, and electric systems.
