# Moments of Power

This website is dedicated to the "moments of power", as introduced in the SAE Paper 2023-01-0541. See https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2023-01-0541/ for the details. 

The key idea is that a power system can be described using a basis function model, for example a polynomial model. 

The methodology applies to a wide range of energy system: automotive, aeronautical, thermal, solar, wind, batteries, fuel cells, and electric systems.
