The basic premis is simple. 

Imagine an energy conversion system, such as an electric motor. 
The input variable is the mechanical power demand $P$, and the output variable is the electrical input power $Y$. 
$Y$ is a function of $P$: 

$$ Y=f(P) $$

This function can be approximated using a polynomial such as:

$$ Y = Y_0 + Y_1 P + Y_2 P^2 + Y_3 Y^3 $$

The overall electrical energy demand can be found by integrating $Y$:

$$ E = \int Y dt $$

So far, so conventional.
